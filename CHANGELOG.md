# Unreleased
- Removed float/double arithmetic from the per-sample path (`OPL_calc()`, `OPL_calcStereo()` and the rate converter) for CPUs without an FPU. The rate converter phase is now derived from the integer output timing, so it no longer drifts and stays aligned after `OPL_load_state()`. (Same as emu2413 Issue[#15](https://github.com/digital-sound-antiques/emu2413/issues/15))
- Fixed the internal rate being truncated to an integer (`clk / 72`). Setting the rate to 49716 at 3.58MHz now disables the rate converter as documented.
- Faster rate converter: the sinc table is laid out per phase and the input buffer is a ring buffer. The phase is now rounded instead of truncated, which removes a constant 1/512-sample delay.
- `OPL_setPanFine()` values are now stored in 4.12 fixed point. The save state format has changed.

# v1.2.2 (2026-10-08)
BugFix: thanks @madscient
- Fixed `OPL_calcStereo()` resampling L and R at different positions when the rate converter is active. (Issue[#5](https://github.com/digital-sound-antiques/emu8950/issues/5))
- Fixed ADPCM RAM/ROM buffers leaking when the chip type is switched away from Y8950. (Issue[#6](https://github.com/digital-sound-antiques/emu8950/issues/6))
- Fixed ADPCM keeping the last decoded value as a DC offset after playback has stopped. (Issue[#7](https://github.com/digital-sound-antiques/emu8950/issues/7))
- Fixed ADPCM playback not stopping when the START bit is cleared. (Issue[#8](https://github.com/digital-sound-antiques/emu8950/issues/8))
- Made internal functions static and removed the `FILE` type reference. (Issue[#9](https://github.com/digital-sound-antiques/emu8950/issues/9))
